# Recursive grep pattern for transcript files to include/exclude
# Supported transcript formats: .odt, .txt, .md
# 'include' can be a string or a list of strings.
include: ["transcripts/**/*.odt", "transcripts/**/*.txt", "transcripts/**/*.md"]
# 'exclude' is optional and can be a string or a list of strings.

# Segmentation options (optional; defaults shown)
# segmentation:
#   segment_paragraphs: 12
#   overlap_paragraphs: 3

# Analysis options (optional; defaults shown)
# analysis:
#   # If true, exclude interviewer statements from coding.
#   # To enable this, add a single metadata paragraph to each transcript:
#   #   interviewer = Name1, Name2

#   # Strategy for LLM calls:
#   #   segment: one call per segment with the full codebook
#   #   topic: one call per segment per topic (more robust, more costly)

# Topics (codebook)
#
# Supported formats for each entry in the 'topics' list:
#   1) Simple:  - Topic: [Orientation1, Orientation2]
#   2) No orientations:  - "Topic"
#   3) Expanded:
#        - topic: "Topic"
#          orientations: [ ... ]   # optional; strings or mappings with descriptions
#          description: "..."    # optional (hint for the LLM)
