Interviewer = S00

S00: Could you briefly describe your teaching background before using the new teaching method?

S01: I have been teaching for around eight years, mostly in large introductory courses, and I had not experimented much with alternative teaching methods before this.

S00: What motivated you to try this particular teaching method?

S01: I joined the project because my department encouraged participation, but I was also hoping it might help students engage more actively during lectures.

S00: How did you integrate the method into your course?

S01: I applied the method throughout the semester, although I adapted it differently depending on the topic and the size of the group.

S00: How did this affect your own teaching?

S01: Teaching became more interactive, but it also felt more demanding and required me to rethink how I plan each session.

S00: Did you observe any effects on student learning?

S01: Students participated more and asked more questions, but I am not sure whether this led to better exam results.

S00: How did students participate during these sessions?

S01: Some students became much more involved over time, while others remained passive despite the new format.

S00: How manageable was the method in terms of workload and resources?

S01: The method fit reasonably well once established, but the initial preparation phase required significant additional effort.

S00: Do you plan to continue using this teaching method in the future?

S01: I would consider continuing to use it if the workload can be reduced and if there is clearer evidence of learning benefits.
