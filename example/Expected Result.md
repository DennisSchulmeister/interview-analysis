# Expected Topics and Orientations

* **Interviews 1–3** demonstrate clean, single-topic paragraphs.

* **Interview 4** demonstrates realistic analytical ambiguity while retaining:

  * a **clear primary topic**, and
  * explicitly documented **secondary topics**.

* This allows to:

  * benchmark **single-label vs. multi-label coding**,
  * test **topic prioritization rules**, or
  * evaluate how the LLM handles compound statements without interpretive inference.
