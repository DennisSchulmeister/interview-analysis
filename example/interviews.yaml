  rules:
    # Specific rule for slightly ambiguous codes
    - "Statements about how a method will be used in the future are coded under Future intentions, not Implementation approach."

    # General coding rules (adopted to the lecturer interview use case)
    - Code only statements made by lecturers; ignore interviewer prompts, paraphrases, or confirmations.
    - Assign a topic only if the statement contains an explicit or clearly inferable evaluative judgment related to that topic.
    - Prefer the most specific topic available; do not assign multiple topics if one clearly dominates the meaning of the segment.
    - Base coding on the expressed perception or experience of the lecturer, not on assumed intentions of students or researchers.
    - When orientations form an ordered scale, select the highest-ranked orientation that is clearly supported by the statement.
    - "Avoid over-interpretation: if a judgment is vague, hedged, or indirect, select a lower-ranked or mixed orientation rather than a clear one."
    - Do not infer outcomes, effects, or motivations that are not explicitly mentioned or strongly implied by the lecturer.
    - If a statement references multiple examples with different valences, code according to the overall emphasis or dominant evaluation.
